## Number Guessing Game

The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple Python program that allows players to guess a random number between 1 and 50. Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number, and they receive feedback after each guess. The game continues until the player either guesses the correct number or runs out of attempts.


## How to Play

1. Run the program using a Python interpreter.

2. You will be informed of the rules:
   - Guess a number from 1 to 50.
   - You have five attempts to guess the correct number.

3. Start guessing by entering a number when prompted.

4. After each guess:
   - If your guess is smaller than the correct number, you will be informed that the correct answer is greater.
   - If your guess is greater than the correct number, you will be informed that the correct answer is smaller.

5. If you guess the correct number, you will receive a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts it took.

6. If you run out of attempts without guessing correctly, you will be informed of the correct answer.

7. After each game, you can choose to play again or exit the program.
